# Neural-Network-for-classification
Deep Learning for classification task  


Objective:
Build Neural Network model for classification task on CIFAR-10 dataset
Use python’s numpy functions to load and transform data
Use keras framework to build a neural network and in the process leverage the key concepts of neural-nets such as learning rate, epochs etc
Perform different experiments on the dataset and arrive at sufficiently good architecture

Code
Build an MLP on MNIST data, with 50 hidden layers each with 50 nodes. Fit the model on train data and report the error. Use autoencoders, dropout, batch normalization as you see fit and obtain 98% accuracy on the test data

CIFAR-10 is a multi-class dataset consisting of 60,000 32 × 32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images [1]. In this paper, we explore different learning classifiers for the image-based multi-class problem.
